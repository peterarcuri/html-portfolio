<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Long Island, NY in the early 1980's ... What a great time to grow up! Having one foot in the new world and one foot in the old world, one 
  got to experience the very beginnings of new technology. There was the IBM pc jr., the Commodore 64, and of course, Atari (the birth of Pacman! What fun!).
</p>

<p>Having been a musician for 25+ years, I truly admire the creative process, as well as, the logical process. Thus, my career in Web Development has just begun.
  In regards to software developement, I've always been fascinated by what is going on "under the hood". Truly excited to begin my journey!
</p>

<p>A few of my past work experiences include: Data entry, inventory clerk, CNA, truck driver, musician, food delivery .. to name a few.
  I'm now excited to start my new journey into a career in software development. 

</p>

<p>Looking forward for the opportunity to prove my worth and add value to any situation that may arise.
  I am eager to showcase my projects as I develop and hone my skills.
