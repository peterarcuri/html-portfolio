    <h1>The Best Movies According to Peter Arcuri</h1>
    <h2> My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

    <hr>

    <h3>The Empire Strikes Back</h3>
    <p> One of the greatest sequels to a Sci-fi film! The characters and storyline are capitaving for all generations.</p>

    <h3>Hereditary</h3>
    <p> Ranks as one of the most, jump-scary, supernatural films you could watch. Not only is the story really good, but will surely scare the crap out of you!!</p>

    <h3>Godzilla Minus One</h3>
    <p>Out of all the Godzilla movies ever made, this one takes the crown!! The special effects are absolutely amazing on this one!! In addition, the script for this film was well written.</p>
